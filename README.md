Hello! I'm Wei En, a data scientist at [SAP](https://github.com/sap). I seek to build robust and efficient machine learning methods (especially in limited data regimes) by integrating aspects of deep learning theory into practice. My current research interests lie towards representation learning and AI benchmarking.

Outside of research, I take an avid interest in open source software engineering and am also passionate in education initiatives targeted at improving access to opportunities for the less privileged. In my free time, I like to brew a fresh cup of coffee/tea and listen to music!
