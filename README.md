### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm Wei En, a Year 3 undergraduate at the National University of Singapore studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I'm generally interested in areas at the intersection of CS and mathematics!

My current research interests are in applications of information theory and algebra to statistical learning theory, with the eventual goal of establishing a rigorous foundation for modern machine learning. Previously, I've worked on research projects at various local research institutes, ranging from block cipher cryptanalysis to quantum simulations and neural networks under Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).

Besides CS research, I take an avid interest in open source software engineering, although I haven't really contributed much to large FOSS projects. I'm also passionate in education initiatives targeted at improving access to opportunities for the less privileged.

In my free time, I like to brew a fresh cup of coffee/tea, listen to music, and occasionally indulge in other recreational activities.
