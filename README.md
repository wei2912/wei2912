Hello! I'm Wei En, a Year 3 undergraduate at the National University of Singapore studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I am currently interested in deep learning theory and its applications towards the development of practical machine learning methods, in aspects such as improving robustness, privacy preservation and knowledge distillation.

Besides CS research, I take an avid interest in open source software engineering, although I haven't contributed much to large FOSS projects. I'm also passionate in education initiatives targeted at improving access to opportunities for the less privileged.

In my free time, I like to brew a fresh cup of coffee/tea, listen to music, and occasionally indulge in other recreational activities.
